# To run a Vite project, you need to follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Your Project Directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory of your Vite project using the cd command. For example:  cd path/to/your/project

2. Install Dependencies (if not already installed): If you haven't installed the project dependencies yet (including Vite itself), you need to do so. You can use npm or Yarn to install dependencies. Here's how you can do it with npm: npm install

3. Run the Development Server: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server. Use the following command:  npm run dev

## That's it! You now know how to run a Vite project. Vite's development server provides a fast and efficient way to develop modern web applications.
